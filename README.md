# No Arrow Keys

An minimalistic, non-intrusive extension to free you from using arrow keys in browser.

You want to navigate faster in your browser? Use this.

## Usage

This is the mappings created by this extension:

`<Alt-P>` = `ArrowUp`

`<Alt-N>` = `ArrowDown`

## Configuration

You can configurate the key bindings from the following links:

## Why?

I have been working with Neovim, Tmux and Leftwm for a while, and working mouse free is awesome. I want to bring that experience to browser, while avoiding a huge script that slows down everything.

Therefore, this extension will never port all keybindings to browser from Vim or Emacs, but only those that are significant.
